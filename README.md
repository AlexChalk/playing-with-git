# Git Experimentation

I created this project to get to grips with git's functionality. I've experimented with branches, tags, merging and rebasing.

## Usage

This project is of no practical use to anyone. However, if you want to inspect what I've done, you can always clone the repository:

`git clone path-to-your-repo`

## Further Notes

This was one of my first pre-course projects whilst enrolled at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).
